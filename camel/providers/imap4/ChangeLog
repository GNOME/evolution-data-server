	* camel-imap4-folder.c (imap4_append_message): The UIDPLUS
	extension doesn't give a "UID APPEND" command, instead it just
	provides the APPENDUID RESP-CODE, so no need to conditionalise the
	command-creation code here. Simply always send "APPEND ..."

2005-03-11  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap4-folder.c (imap4_sync): Don't try to EXPUNGE in
	READ-ONLY mode.
	(imap4_sync_changes): Don't check permanent_flags here.
	(imap4_sync): Check permanent_flags here instead and don't bother
	wasting cycles if permanent_flags is empty.
	(imap4_sync): Don't attempt to EXPUNGE if the folder is READ-ONLY.
	(imap4_append_message): Set an exception if the folder is
	read-only and don't bother trying to append.

	* camel-imap4-engine.c (camel_imap4_engine_select_folder): Set the
	READ-ONLY bit on the folder if the server says we've opened it in
	READ-ONLY mode.

2005-02-03  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap4-engine.c (camel_imap4_engine_handle_untagged_1):
	Handle XGWMOVE untagged events as EXPUNGE events.

	* camel-imap4-folder.c (imap4_transfer_messages_to): Optionally
	use XGWMOVE if the extension is available.

	* camel-imap4-engine.c (camel_imap4_engine_capability): Query for
	the XGWEXTENSIONS as well if the server supports it.

2005-02-14  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap4-store-summary.c (store_info_to_folder_info):

	fix.

	* camel-imap4-store.c (imap4_build_folder_info): Translate the
	name of Inbox.

2005-02-13  Björn Torkelsson  <torkel@acc.umu.se>

	* camel-imap4-store.c (imap4_build_folder_info): Add flags if it
	is inbox.

2005-02-10  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap4-search.c (imap4_body_contains): If we're in offline
	mode, let the parent implementation perform the search.

2005-02-04  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-imap4-store.c (imap4_build_folder_info): always get the
	subscription info.
	(camel_imap4_store_class_init): added a fixme about
	folder_subscribed not being implemented.

2005-02-02  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap4-store.c (imap4_build_folder_info): Set the
	CAMEL_FOLDER_SUBSCRIBED bit on the fi->flags if the info was
	gotten via an LSUB response.
	(imap4_build_folder_info): If our caller has requested
	subscription info, make sure to get it.
	(imap4_subscription_info): Get whether or not a folder is
	subscribed.

2005-02-01  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap4-summary.c (imap4_header_load): Changed to have the
	'have_mlist' bit be a summary flag rather than a new value stored
	in the summary header.
	(imap4_header_save): No longer need to save the have_mlist value
	ourselves.
	(camel_imap4_summary_flush_updates): Updated to use summary flags

2005-02-01  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap4-provider.c: Added command option.
	Reset back to imap4:// uris.

	* camel-imap4-engine.c (camel_imap4_engine_parse_resp_code):
	handle CAMEL_IMAP4_RESP_CODE_ALERT explicitly in the switch
	statement and have it break out. This prevents the code from
	getting to the "unknown resp-code" code path that prints a warning
	unnecessarily.

2005-01-31  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap4-engine.c (camel_imap4_engine_iterate): On connect

	case, xfer the ic1 exception, not the ic0 exception (which might
	not even exist). Fixes bug #71919.
