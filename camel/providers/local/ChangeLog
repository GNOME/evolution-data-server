	** See bug #59507

	* camel-spool-store.c (spool_get_full_path): handle mbox/elm cases
	explictly, not based on stat of path.
	(spool_get_meta_path): store all meta files in ~/.evolution
	somewhere.

	special case test for a direct folder, leave it to subclasses to
	decide.

	* camel-local-store.c (local_get_trash, local_get_junk): calculate
	the state file based on the new store get_meta_path calls.  Also
	use the CAMEL_VJUNK_NAME, etc.

	* camel-local-folder.c, camel-local-store.c: Moved the
	get_meta_path and get_full_path routines to the store instead of
	the folder.  fix all subclasses.
