	* camel-sendmail-transport.c: Use g_ascii_strcasecmp() instead of
	strcasecmp(). The strings we are comparing are just ASCII anyway,
	so spell it out that we really do need ASCII casefolding only.

	** See bug #300891
	
	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): define

	* camel-sendmail-provider.c (camel_provider_module_init):
	set translation_domain in CamelProvider struct.
