	* camel-imap-store.c (camel_imap_store_summary_full_to_path,
	camel_imap_store_summary_path_to_full): Remove extraneous
	conversions from IMAP-UTF-7 to UTF-8 and back.

	* camel-imap-command.c (imap_command_strdup_vprintf): Do the
	conversion from UTF-8 to IMAP-UTF-7 only just before sending a
	request. Do it also for %S formats, as that is what the CREATE
	command uses. But %S is used also for other commands (like LOGIN
	and LIST), so maybe we really would need a new format that would
	be used *only* for mailbox (folder) names, assuming it's only
	mailbox names that use the IMAP-UTF-7 encoding. Or is that what %F
	is intended for? But why then does CREATE use %S?

2005-12-08  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* camel-imap-folder.c: Drop unused <dirent.h>.

	* camel-imap-message-cache.c: Use gstdio wrappers. Open files in
	binary mode.

	(insert_setup, camel_imap_message_cache_get): Trailing periods in
	file names are silently dropped on Win32, so on Win32, so if we
	would want to create a file with a name ending with a perioud,
	append a tilde (just a random choice).

	* camel-imap-provider.c: No external command possibility on Win32,
	drop that part of the UI.

	* camel-imap-store.c: Use gstdio wrappers.

	* camel-imap-utils.c (find_folders_recursive): Use GDir instead of

	* camel-imap-folder.c: Use g_ascii_str(n)casecmp() instead of

	need ASCII casefolding only.

	* camel-imap-folder.c
	* camel-imap-search.c
	* camel-imap-store.c: No strtok_r() in Microsoft's C library, but
	strtok() is MT-safe, which is enough for the way it's used in this
	file, to tokenize only one string at a time.

	* camel-imap-store.c (connect_to_server_process,
	connect_to_server_wrapper): Using custom commands to connect to

	* camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_offline): use the store summary

	* camel-imap-store.c (connect_to_server): add the BRAINDAMAGED
	hack from 2.0.3, since some people seem to be relying on it.

2005-08-01  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_info_offline): if we're getting
	from "", then use the right namespace, with stripped trailing dir
	separator.
	(get_folders_online): we always do both a list and a lsub for each
	call.  We dont actually return any folders anymore either.
	(refresh_refresh): we just refresh all folders, subscribed or not.
	(get_folder_info_online): if we're getting the folder list, update
	the folder-summary from the server results, and then just get the
	folderinfo from that using get_folder_info_offline.
	(get_folders_sync): renamed from get_folders_online.
	(imap_connect_online): get the root list of folders differently,
	it will explictly check the namespace first.  and just make sure
	inbox is subscribed.
	(imap_is_subfolder, get_subscribed_folders) 
	(get_folders_add_folders, get_folders): removed old stuff.

2005-07-28  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #311731.

	folderinfo from the search base so we dont over-expand it.

2005-07-27  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_info_online): make sure we get
	subscribed folders using lsub too, if we're getting a list of all
	folders.  See bug #311658.

	* camel-imap-folder.c (imap_sync_online): make sure we're
	connected before issuing a command.

	* camel-imap-wrapper.h: Fix camel-docs breakage by changing
	style
	
2005-07-20  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-imap-store.h: re-arrange some bitfields (this is not
	public api), and add a refresh stamp so we know when to next
	refresh the list of folders from the server.

	* camel-imap-store.c (imap_build_folder_info): set unknown counts
	-1, not 0.
	(get_folder_online): if the folder is on disk, just get it
	offline, only go to the server if we need to.
	(fill_fi): dont refresh the folder here, let the client code do
	it.

	* camel-imap-command.c (imap_command_start): add some asserts,
	time to fix those 'stream == NULL' warnings properly.
	(camel_imap_command_continuation): same.

	* camel-imap-store.c (get_folder_counts): remove this, we rely on
	the client calling folder.refresh_info instead.
	(get_one_folder_offline): removed, handled more directly from the
	storesummary now.
	(refresh_refresh): new async function to update the list of
	folders (not the folder counts) from the server.  We now just use
	"*" to get all the folders rather than frobbing around with
	partial fetches.
	(get_folder_info_online): changed radically, if we are getting
	subscribed folders, always go to the local list, but update it
	asynchronously if we need to.  if we're not, then always go to the
	server, but use a simplified listing mechanism.
	(camel_imap_store_connected): changed to hide some hidden logic,
	we want not only connected, but online as well; so make it
	actually do that.
	(fill_fi): dont do anything slow here, dont honour the 'not fast'
	flag anymore.

2005-07-19  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	until we need it.
	(camel_imap_folder_fetch_data): force a connect if we need it.
	(imap_refresh_info): force connect if we need to.
	(imap_get_message): touch the summary if we changed the body
	content info record.

	* camel-imap-store.c (camel_imap_store_init): we always support
	subscriptions, this is a backend property not a store instance
	property.
	(imap_connect_online, rename_folder, get_one_folder_offline) 
	(get_folder_info_offline): fix for above.
	(get_folder_offline): wtf is it connecting for???

2005-07-13  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

2005-03-18  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap-command.c (imap_read_untagged): Continue reading data
	until we've read all the data (camel_stream_read() makes no
	guarantee that it will read n bytes in a single call).

2005-03-10  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap-folder.c (imap_sync_online): READ-ONLY doesn't mean
	we can't sync flags, allow flag syncing even in READ-ONLY mode
	since the RFC states that flags listed in PERMANENTFLAGS are
	always settable.

2005-03-07  JP Rosevear  <jpr@novell.com>

	From Dave Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>
