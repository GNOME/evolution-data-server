This is the list of tests I've been using while writing e-vcard.c.
The parser is all handcrafted, and it's not a validating parser by any
stretch of the imagination.  It tries very hard to deal with any
possible input (it'll even parse rfc822 mail headers and spit out
vCard-ish results.)

Test   : Description
----------------------

1.vcf  : Frank Dawson's vCard from RFC 2426 (missing the required N
         attribute.)

2.vcf  : Tim Howes's vCard from from RFC 2426 (missing the required N
         attribute.)

3.vcf  : Nat's old vCard.

4.vcf  : A vCard containing a canadian address (quoted-printable
        encoded attribute values.)

5.vcf  : A vCard containing utf8 characters quoted-printable encoded.

6.vcf  : A vCard with several errors in attribute parameters:
	 line 5: a missing parameter value (a , with nothing after it).
         line 6: a missing parameter name when using multiple
                 values. (this may not be in violation of the rfc.)
	 line 7: a missing parameter name when using multiple
                 values. (this may not be in violation of the rfc.)

7.vcf  : A vCard missing its begin:vcard attribute, as well as missing
         the required N attribute.

8.vcf  : A vCard missing its end: vcard attribute, as well as missing
         the required N attribute.

9.vcf  : A vCard that ends (\0) in the middle of an attribute
         name/group.

10.vcf : A vCard with an attribute with more than 1 group specified.  Also
         has an attributed with a quoted parameter value.

11.vcf : A vCard with invalid attribute parameter specs.

12.vcf : A vCard with quoted parameter values that get corrupted if the
         line folding mechanism does not correctly remove the equal sign

13.vcf : A vCard with various escaped characters
