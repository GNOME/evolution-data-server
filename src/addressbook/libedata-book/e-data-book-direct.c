/**
 * SECTION: e-data-book-direct
 * @include: libedata-book/libedata-book.h
 * @short_description: An interface for implementing Direct Read Access
 *
 * This class should be created by an #EBookBackendClass.get_direct_book()
 * implementation of a backend which supports direct read access.
 *
 * This will only be asked of the backend when instantiated on the server
 * side. If the server side instance of an #EBookBackend does return
 * an #EDataBookDirect, then a client side instance of the same backend
 * will be created and #EBookBackendClass.configure_direct() will be
 * called on the corresponding client side instance.
