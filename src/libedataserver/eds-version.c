/**
 * eds_check_version:
 * @required_major: the required major version
 * @required_minor: the required minor version
 * @required_micro: the required micro version
 *
 * Checks that the Evolution-Data-Server library in use is compatible with
 * the given version.  Generally you would pass in the constants
 * #EDS_MAJOR_VERSION, #EDS_MINOR_VERSION, #EDS_MICRO_VERSION as the three
 * arguments to this function.  That produces a check that the library in
 * use is compatible with the version of Evolution-Data-Server the
 * application or module was compiled against.
 *
 * Returns: (nullable): %NULL if the Evolution-Data-Server library is
 * compatible with the given version, or a string describing the version
 * mismatch.  The returned string is owned by libedataserver and must not be
 * modified or freed.
 *
 * Since: 2.24
